# COMP-B13
All of my programming assignments from my Computer Architecture and Organization course at Bakersfield College in Spring 2020

Class Work
----------
  - 01.21.20  - Assignment 1: AvgNoZero **C**: Builds an array of floating point numbers from input on the command line, and prints the average value of all the non-zero numbers the user has input.
  - 02.19.20  - Assignment 2: TwosComplement **C**: Takes strings of binary numbers as command line arguments, and converts them in-place to their two's complement equivalents, then prints them out. Also includes an alternate implementation without using if-statements, which I wrote as a challenge to myself. This implementation currently only works with some versions of the GNU compiler, I may come back later and see if I can make it work universally.
